# The immune microenvironment of human glioblastoma

## Purpose

This serves as a public repository of code used for all analyses in PhD thesis 'The immune microenvironment of human glioblastoma', submitted to University of Liverpool January 2026.

## Raw data availability

Due to patient confidentiality and institutional governance restrictions, raw and processed data used in this thesis are not publicly available and are therefore not included in this repository.

## Requirements

This project was carried out using the following programs:
- R v4.4.1

## Content

The code is provided to document the analytical approach, processing steps, and figure generation logic, including during exploratory analyses. Analysis scripts are therefore not  intended as a fully automated pipeline or to run in the absence of the raw data, and may require manual adaptation to run in a new environment

Scripts reference local data directories used during the PhD, including the following examples, as well as additional subdirectories specifically referenced within the code:

GBM_single_cell_analysis/

├── data/

└── outputs/

GBM_spatial_analysis/

├── data/

└── outputs/

These directories are expected to exist outside the repository root and contain processed data objects generated during the analysis pipeline.
